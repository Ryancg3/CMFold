\usage{
mclassiTies(x, knn, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of distances of a new trajectory to all training trajectories.}

\item{knn}{number of nearest neighbours}
}
\description{
Provides the positions of the indices of the k nearest trajectories.
Selects randomly among ties for the \eqn{k}th nearest trajectory.
}
\examples{
## distance of new data to the 10 trajectories in the training data:
dist_to_train_fucntions = c(1,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5,6)
mclassiTies(x = dist_to_train_fucntions, knn=3)
